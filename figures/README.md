> This is a correlation matrix constructed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, showing the correlation between different audio features. The correlation matrix reveals a robust positive correlation between danceability and energy. Additionally, there is a somewhat weaker correlation observed between valence and energy, as well as between danceability and valence. On the other hand, there is a strong negative correlation between energy and acousticness.
